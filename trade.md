  It's important to emphasize that $RCAX may not carry any intrinsic monetary
  value; it serves exclusively as a utility token integral to RCAX's future Web3

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to buy large amounts of $RCAX, it "might" be cheaper to buy and burn RCA's for mining rewards instead. You should check the current mining rewards and the current floor prices of each RCA generation that is eligible for a mine reward. Please do your due diligence and trade at your own risk of course!
