# ðŸ§¡ Introduction

The RCAX project, formerly known as Snoovatars, was born with a mission to enhance the Reddit Collectible Avatars (RCA) ecosystem. Every day, thousands of traders and collectors turn to RCAX.io for our real-time market insights, price alerts, and various other tools on both desktop and mobile.

While we've been at the forefront of serving the RCA community using Web2, we've also been exploring new horizons. After months of brainstorming, we're excited to introduce our new plans going forward.&#x20;

Starting with $RCAX. A Polygon based token that can only be mined by burning Avatars ðŸ”¥.
