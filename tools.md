**Random Avatar Swap** \
[**https://rcax.io/dapps/randomavatarswap**](https://rcax.io/dapps/randomavatarswap)

This dApp can be used to swap your Reddit Collectible Avatar with another random one from the dApp pool. The Avatars in the pool are provided by so called liquidity providers. The pools are separated by the release generation. So if you send a generation 1 Avatar, you will always get another generation 1 Avatar in return. The first swap is free. Any swap afterwards will cost a service fee in $RCAX which differs per Avatar. Liquidity providers will earn half of the service fee whenever one of their avatars is swapped.

**Marketplace**\
_In development - not live yet_

Buy and sell Reddit Collectible Avatars and other related collections through the RCAX marketplace using $RCAX.
